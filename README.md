A Battleship AI that uses a probabilistic model to determine the best spot to shoot at for the next turn.

Uses a probability calculation by overlaying all ship orientations across the board to pinpoint the most likely square to contain a ship.
Achieves an average of 45 moves to clear a regular battleship board, as opposed to the 97 turns averaged by a bot choosing random squares.

Is susceptible to certain human tactics which may be designed to intentionally avoid high probability areas.
